# ServiceNow Killed aka SNKilled

Showing features in their state of decay

## What is this?

This is a list to simply see on a feature by feature basis what is and is not ‚Äúcurrent‚Äù in ServiceNow.
Why?

- I can‚Äôt remember this stuff
- It‚Äôs easier to search a list than it is to ask me or find it in the docs

### Can you elaborate on that?

Sure. ServiceNow has a lot of offerings. Over time the offerings change and sometimes merge/split/replace eachother. They have to keep the old things because making a customer move off of some old tech is not a good thing to tell someone. However, that leaves it up to the admins and developers to somehow know what is current. The purpose of this is just to track the things and their last update or if they have been replaced by some other feature. Some simple examples. Execution Plans(sometimes called deliever plans) were used for a long time. However Workflow was added in 2009. You can still use workflow today. Flow designer was introduced in 2017, it does things workflow did. Should you still use workflow? Well you can. But new development is happening in Flow designer.
